To run and actually *see* the app, not just one or two invisible windows:

# Lower the framerate

If you redraw the image every 0.3 seconds the windows will show.

Yes, this is super strange.

# Run through the preview

In the source file, press the top right corner menu and enable "Canvas".

Get the canvas going, then press the Bring Forward button.

Then close one of the windows if you have two.

I have no idea why this helps.
